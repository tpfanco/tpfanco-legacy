Tpfanco is a free and open source fan control software for IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads running GNU/Linux. It consists of a fan control daemon and a GUI to monitor tempertature sensor values and set thresholds. For selected ThinkPad models user-generated fan profiles are available.

This software works only on ThinkPad models supported by the **thinkpad\_acpi** kernel module. In particular, SL series and IdeaPads are not supported!

Tpfanco is based on [tp-fan](http://www.gambitchess.org/mediawiki/index.php) by Sebastian Urban. When it became clear, that tp-fan is not likely to receive any further updates (last version was released in 2009), we decided to fork it and give our project the name Tpfanco (acronym for ThinkPad Fan Control).
